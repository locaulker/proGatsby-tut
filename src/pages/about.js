        This is About text. Pluto is so much different from the giant planets
        that since Clyde Tombaugh discovered it in 1930, various hypotheses
        about the origin of Pluto have been put forward many times. It is known
        that the position of Pluto with the solar system contradicts the
        empirical rule ofbundleRenderer.renderToStream. Titius-Bode, which
        predicts for him the semimajor axis of the orbit of 77 AU(With a real
        value of 39 AU).
